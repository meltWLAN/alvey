## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on the Alveychain NFT platform contracts. The scope included an NFT contract, a staking contract, and their associated functionality. The audit identified several areas of improvement, though the overall contract security is good with proper use of OpenZeppelin libraries and security patterns.

## Scope

The following contracts were audited:
- `AlveyNFT.sol` - The main NFT contract implementing ERC721
- `AlveyNFTSimple.sol` - A simplified NFT implementation
- `StakingContract.sol` - Contract for staking NFTs to earn rewards

## Findings and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

**Private Key Exposure**
- Finding: There's a private key hardcoded in `hardhat.config.js`
- Recommendation: IMMEDIATELY replace this key and move it to an environment variable using `dotenv` or similar.
```javascript
// BAD: const PRIVATE_KEY = "0xc1ff538fbd0168791e5fd767bdb3379b95f3115c95c54fe25a6c28b7bebeda3a";
// GOOD: const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```

### High Risk Issues

**Insufficient Token Validation**
- Finding: The NFT contract accepts any ERC20 token address without validation in the constructor
- Recommendation: Add validation to ensure the provided token address is a valid ERC20

**Uncapped Rewards Accumulation**
- Finding: The StakingContract doesn't cap time-based rewards, which could lead to extremely large reward calculations
- Recommendation: Implement a maximum accumulation period or a cap on rewards per token

### Medium Risk Issues

**Manual Token Recovery**
- Finding: No mechanism to recover accidentally sent ERC721 tokens to the StakingContract
- Recommendation: Implement a token recovery function for owner

**Missing Pausable in StakingContract**
- Finding: The StakingContract doesn't implement a pause mechanism for emergencies
- Recommendation: Add Pausable functionality like in the NFT contract

### Low Risk Issues

**TokenURI Sanitization**
- Finding: AlveyNFT doesn't sanitize TokenURIs, which could lead to XSS in frontends
- Recommendation: Implement URI sanitization or validation

**Gas Optimization in _removeStake**
- Finding: Inefficient array management in _removeStake function
- Recommendation: Consider using a mapping for O(1) lookups instead of array iteration

## Code Issues by Contract

### AlveyNFT.sol

1. **Reentrancy Risk**: While the contract uses OpenZeppelin's secure functions, the `transferFrom` before state changes in `safeMint` and `batchMint` creates a theoretical reentrancy opportunity with non-standard tokens.

2. **URI Management**: No validation of URI formats, which could lead to frontend security issues.

3. **Transfer Safety**: The contract uses `paymentToken.transferFrom` but doesn't handle the case where the token reverts silently.

### StakingContract.sol

1. **Reward Calculation**: The time-weighted reward calculation can lead to extremely large rewards over time, potentially exceeding contract balance.

2. **Function Ordering**: State changes after external calls in some functions, consider reordering.

3. **Missing Pausable**: Unlike the NFT contract, there's no emergency pause mechanism.

## Test Coverage Analysis

Comprehensive security tests were added for:
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control
- Reward calculation security
- Parameter update security
- Emergency functions
- DoS protections
- Edge cases

## Recommendations for Frontend Security

1. **URI Sanitization**: Ensure all tokenURIs are sanitized before rendering
2. **Connection Validation**: Verify the connected chain is Alveychain
3. **Transaction Verification**: Show users transaction details before signing

## Conclusion

The contracts implement good security practices including:
- Use of OpenZeppelin's standard contracts
- ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy
- Proper access control with Ownable
- Event emission for important state changes

Addressing the identified issues, particularly the private key exposure and reward calculation concerns, will significantly improve the security posture of the platform.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended fixes
2. Run the security tests to verify fixes
3. Consider a formal audit by a professional security firm before mainnet deployment
